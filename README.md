# FZWeather
Goal:
Write an app that retrieves information from OpenWeather API, and list
the daily weather forecast for the next five days for a specific city.
Every day should be a section and every 3 hour forecast a cell within that
section.
Sections must clearly show the date.
Cells must show the time and temperature. 

Extras:
• Show the weather icon in each cell (download and cache it. Do not
bundle it in the App)
• Add a search bar to enable search of weather info for any city.
• Store the city information for situations where there is not
connection
• Add a detailed view for each city, clicking on a stored city would
present all the info of the city model, including a map view with a
pin on the city’s coordinates.
